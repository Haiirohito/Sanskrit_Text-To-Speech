This is a Natural Language Processing of sanskrit language.

motive:
-> We need to recognize sanskrit scrpits out of all the languages.

-> Then we perform text-to-speech of sanskrit input text: right now thinking of something like Making our own API, to perform all of these
   or we can use some free APIs like voicerrs one and google's pre-built API for voice assistance.

-> This all is integrated in a web page via web development.

Python library used:
-> SkLearn.
-> text-to-speech(best will be to use bhashini provided by Indian government). optimise bhashini for government of India.
-> Flask or Django for web development based work to integrate the program with User Interface.

objective:
-> Increase awareness about sanskrit language.
-> need accurate pronunciation.
-> Help in the learning of a language.
-> can be built in the form of a learning platform like, duolingo.

Web dev-based part:
-> Will use MERN type of javascript development for web page, that will increase the usability of the code/program.
-> Learn How to do the web development.
